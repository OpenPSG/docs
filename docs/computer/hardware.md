# Hardware

Almost any modern Laptop can be used with OpenPSG, see the [Browser Support](./browser)
section for details.

Below is just a small selection of hardware that has been tested with OpenPSG.

## ChromeOS

### Dell Chromebook 3100

The author of OpenPSG personally uses an old [Dell Chromebook 3100](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/chromebook-3100-laptop/spd/chromebook-11-3100-laptop) 
for making recordings.

Chromebooks are a great choice for OpenPSG as they are small, inexpensive, 
power efficient, often passively cooled (very quiet), and can easily be left on 
a bedside table.
